title: QPot v1.1: The R Package for SDEs
---

23 October 2015
<br>
We've released QPot v1.1 into the wild!  
<br>
QPot, the R software package for analyzing stochastic differential equations using the quasipotential, has been updated to version 1.1.  The help files have been updated.  The function Model2String has been updated to replace parameter names with parameter values for both simple strings as well as the function format used by deSolve.
<br>
QPot is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=QPot. Our paper demonstrating applications of QPot has been resubmitted to the R Journal.  A preprint version can be downloaded at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07992">http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07992</a>
