About me.

My research interests revolve around understanding how individual-level interactions, such as competition or herbivory, scale up to affect dynamics at the population, metapopulation, and landscape levels. I combine mathematical models and field experiments to develop, test, and refine predictions.  I am currently developing mathematical models to understand the effects of various plant defenses on herbivore population dynamics and the feedback between the two systems as an attempt to use bottom-up processes to mitigate pest outbreaks.

I am currently in the Abbott Lab at Case Western Reserve University.

I collaborate with the Poveda Lab at Cornell University.
