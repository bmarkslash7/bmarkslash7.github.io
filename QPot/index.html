<h2>QPot</h2>
<h3>an R package for analyzing SDEs and computing quasi-potential</h3>


<a href = "https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/nolting-moore-stieha-etal.pdf">Download</a> our R Journal article on using QPot.
<br>These examples are webpages with code and R output
<br><a href = "examples/Example1-twostableeq.html">Example 1 with two stable equilibria</a>
<br><a href = "examples/Example2-limitcycle.html">Example 2 with a limit cycle</a>
<br> The article contains a third example that involves combining two local quasi-potentials that are difficult to combine into a global quasi-potential
<br>NOTE: Example 1 can be change to a limit cycle with 
<br>model.parms <- c(alpha = 1.5, beta = 45, delta = 10, gamma = 5, kappa = 18, mu = 4)
<br> You will need to check boundaries!


<br><br>
To show the usefulness of the quasi-potential, we can analyze Lotka-Voltera competition models.
<br>These examples are R script files.
