We've released QPot into the wild!  
<br>
From Ben's press release:
<br>
Researchers in Dr. Karen Abbott’s theoretical ecology lab in the Department of Biology at Case Western Reserve University have recently released a software package that will help scientists studying stochastic dynamical systems. The package, written for the programming language R, is called QPot (short for quasi-potential, which is one of the its primary analytic tools). Professor Karen Abbott’s lab, which includes research associates Christopher Moore, Christopher Stieha, and Ben Nolting, collaborated with Professor Maria Cameron from the University of Maryland to create QPot, which they hope will be useful to researchers in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from ecology to physics. QPot is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=QPot. A paper demonstrating applications of QPot has been submitted to the R Journal and can be downloaded at (to be filled shortly).
