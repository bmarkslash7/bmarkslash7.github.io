	I am an ecologist whose research interests revolve around understanding how individual-level interactions, such as competition or herbivory, scale up to affect dynamics at the population, metapopulation, and landscape levels. To answer my questions, I use mathematical models, computer simulations, laboratory experiments, and field biology to develop, test, and refine predictions.  I am currently developing mathematical models to understand the effects of various plant defenses on herbivore population dynamics and the feedback between the two systems as an attempt to use bottom-up processes to mitigate pest outbreaks.  I also use mathematical models and field experiments to quantify the effects of spatial arrangement of populations on the maintenance of the sexes.
