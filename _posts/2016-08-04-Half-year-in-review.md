title: The first half of 2016 in review

4 August 2016
<br>
It's always good to pause and take stock of what has happened.  I usually do this personally, but figured I could also post about it as news to catch up on my backlog of things that have happened.
<br><br>
In February, our paper on the effects of plant compensatory regrowth on herbivore population dynamics was published in The American Naturalist. 
<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684522"> http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684522 </a>
Long story short, plant compensatory regrowth, by themselves, can cause herbivore populations to cycle and can interact with plant resistance to produce non-intuitive effects on herbivore dynamics.
<br>
Simeon Yurek and Don DeAngelis at the Faculty of 100 website have <a href="http://f1000.com/prime/726099606"> a great write-up of the paper.  </a>

<br><br>
To appear in the special issue of Evolutionary Ecology on clonal plants, our paper on the maintenance of the sexes in metapopulations of varying spatial configuration is already online.  <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10682-016-9841-8"> http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10682-016-9841-8 </a>
When males and females compete to the point of exclusion and both can asexually reproduce, the spatial arrangement of the subpopulations within a metapopulation can drastically affect whether both sexes are maintained and whether the metapopulation persists.  Basically, maintenance and persistence require dispersal, but not too much dispersal by asexual propagules.

Our R Journal article for our package QPot, has been accepted and should appear on their page soon:
<a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/"> https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/ </a>
<br>
QPot is currently available through CRAN.  Once we have the official R Journal article, I'll include that as a vignette and update the QPot package.

<br><br>
And with all that said, back to deal with the multiple papers that came back recently and require my attention NOW!
